# 🧠 C Programming Exercises

This repository contains solved exercises in the C programming language, organized by topic. It is part of my learning journey and practice, focusing on programming logic, basic structures, and intermediate-level concepts.

## 📚 Folder Structure

- `primeiros_passos/` — Input/output, operators, and first experiments
- `funcoes/` — Basic functions, parameters, and logic exercises
- `ponteiros/` — Pointer manipulation and pass-by-reference
- `arrays/` — One-dimensional arrays (vectors)
- `matriz/` — Two-dimensional arrays (matrices), row/column sums, element search
- `string/` — Reading and manipulating strings
- `modulacao/` — Modular programs using .c and .h files
- `struct/` — Structs declaration, arrays, and function usage
- `manipulacao_arquivos/` — File reading and writing (.txt)
- `exercicios/` — Extra solved exercises and challenges
- `projeto/` — More complex code and experimental work
